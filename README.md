3d-object-finder
================

The necessary components to get a small 3D object finder game working in Unity, aim is to find and tap the lone sphere.

You can rotate left/right and up/down by moving one open hand above the Leap controller on the x- and y-axis. By rotating one open hand around the z-axis you can rotate the view around the z-axis. To move forward, hold two open hands over the Leap controller, slightly apart.

Attach the three C# scripts to the Main Camera, attach the material (FingerPalmSphereMatieral.mat) to the FingerSphere.prefab and attach FingerSphere.prefab and PalmSphereBlank.prefab to the the Finger and Palm templates of the new LeapConnect2 script component now on the the main character.

That should have you up and running in the development environment and free to experiment! :D
